Welcome stranger, 


I am a postdoc in political science at the Goethe University Frankfurt (Chair of Comparative Politics). I am interested in the way politicians and political parties divide society and politics up into camps and groups - both in their open political communication and their hidden targeting strategies. 

In their communication, parties distinguish between the "us" and "them", the good and bad, the deserving and undeserving. They do this by critizing other parties and thereby signaling to voters the camp they belong to and the politics they oppose (see my article on negative campaigning). They also do it by supporting certain social groups such as women or workers, and critizing other social groups such as immigrants or employers (see my thesis on group appeals). 

Social groups also play a more hidden role for political parties by helping them to focus their campaign on those voters they are most hopeful to win over. The way parties target voters online and the possible implications for democratic discourse is a second research interest of mine (see my working papers on targeting).  

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:stuckelberger@soz.uni-frankfurt.de) for questions or collaborations.  



in case I don't see you: Good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.
